# DSAlgorithms-in-cpp-roadmap
My projects that helped me to learn the foundations of data, structures and algorithms using c++. Contains several projects that exhibits
my knowledge about the foundations of data structures and algorithms using the c++ language.

## Run requirements

For every c++ program in this repo it is only needed a code editor and the libraries needed are specified on every project description.

## Linear search program

A code that uses the linear search algoriithm to find a target value into a given list, it returns the position of the target value in the list if present or else it will throw a message indicating the value was not found.
